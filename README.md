# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends, using Excel built-in functions and pivot charts.
## Overview of Project
Louise is an up-and-coming playwright, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, ***Fever***. <br>
She has estimated a budget of over $10,000 and is understandably hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. <br>

Louise has provided us with an Excel data file that contains details about crowdfunding campaigns based majorly in the <br> the United States. <br>

Using Excel to analyze Kickstarters data will help us understand campaigns from start to finish and enable us to help Louise set her campaign to mirror other successful ones in the same category.

### Purpose 
We aim to organize, sort and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful. 
We will focus on comparing kickstarters concerning interest, finances, timing, location, and other confounding factors that may influence the trajectory of a campaign. Furthermore, we will provide visual representations of the data in full, campaigns' outcomes, plus chronological and statistical analyses. 

The insights gained from this comprehensive analysis will help Louise plan her Kickstarter campaign and set it up for success.
